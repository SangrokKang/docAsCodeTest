In webOS Open Source Edition (OSE), not only developers with different interests, but also users can participate.
<h2 id="system-ui-developers">System UI Developers <i class="fa fa-link fa-lg"></i></h2>
The webOS user experience is delivered by the System UI, based on Blink and Qt. Developers can add new features and integrate other open source technologies to enhance the user experience.
<h2 id="platform-developers">Platform Developers <i class="fa fa-link fa-lg"></i></h2>
Our platform portability layer (PPL), code-named Nyx, is the basis for porting webOS OSE to new architectures and hardware.

Developers can work from the Linux kernel on up to the System UI and System Services, including enhancing the PPL itself.
<h2 id="app-developers">App Developers <i class="fa fa-link fa-lg"></i></h2>
The primary means of developing apps will be via JavaScript-based application frameworks. webOS OSE will be optimized for the Enact framework, but other JavaScript frameworks can also be used. Developers can enhance our Core applications, or bring new applications for consideration.
<h2 id="users">Users <i class="fa fa-link fa-lg"></i></h2>
Enthusiast users can help with documentation, help with testing and submit bugs, and discuss features.

Come discuss with us on the forum.
