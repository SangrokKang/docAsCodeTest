A few things to do before jumping into the repositories.

Joining allows you to contribute code, participate in the forums, report and track bugs, and receive updates on the latest webOS Open Source Edition developments.
<h2 id="get-familiar-with-the-components">Get familiar with the Components <i class="fa fa-link fa-lg"></i></h2>
Check out our repositories on GitHub to review our components and README files. If you are brand new to coding and/or to GitHub, check out Requirements.
<h2 id="discuss-your-idea">Discuss Your Idea <i class="fa fa-link fa-lg"></i></h2>
We strongly suggest you check the forum and post your ideas before you start updating components. First of all, you can find out if someone else is working on a similar idea. Furthermore, community members can help you refine your concept.
